        <p>
            Every scripting language is basically a programming language. The only theoretical difference is that a
            scripting language does not include the compilation step- it is interpreted instead. For instance, one needs
            to first compile a C program before running it. On the other hand, one does not need to compile a scripting
            language such as PHP or JavaScript. There are various ways in which both languages vary. In this website, we
            will dive deeper into the difference between scripting and programming languages. But let us first take a
            brief look at both of them.
